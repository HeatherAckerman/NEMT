            <p>Many health insurance providers want to make sure that their members can make it to their necessary medical appointments regardless of their circumstances. To make this happen they offer Non-emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) to their members who need it. A NEMT provider is the medical taxi that provides that service. This site contains an overview of how to become a NEMT provider. </p>
